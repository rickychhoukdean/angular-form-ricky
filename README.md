# angular-form-ricky



I wasn't able to validate the HTML through site ( https://angular-form-ricky.stackblitz.io ) due to the stackblitz wrapping  so I did the checking manually by moving everything into a seperate HTML file and validated that. I have attached that html file as validate.html so you can test yourself.
I have added a date polyfill in the to deal with the warning given by the HTML validator.

The same applies to validating the CSS but for this I just manually validated - if there was a way to do it not manually I would love to know!

Since there were no clear guidelines on what to make responsive I decided on three things.
1. Make image list full size on phones but fixed size on tablets and up.
2. Make the radio buttons vertically aligned on phones but horizontally aligned on everything else.
3. Make the form inputs/buttons full on phones but fixed 75% width on everything tablets and up.
