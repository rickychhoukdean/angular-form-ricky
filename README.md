# angular-form-ricky

I wasn't able to validate the HTML through site ( https://angular-form-ricky.stackblitz.io ) due to the stackblitz wrapping  so I did the checking manually by moving everything into a seperate HTML file and validated that. I have attached that html file as validate.html so you can test yourself.
I have added a date polyfill in the to deal with the warning given by the HTML validator.

The same applies to validating the CSS but for this I just manually validated - if there was a way to do it not manually I would love to know!

I made the form responsive by being full width in mobile sizes and floating in larger sizes.
